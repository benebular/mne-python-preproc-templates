# mne-python-preproc-templates
Adapted template scripts for preprocessing MEG data in MNE-Python

The main folder includes examples of preprocessing for eventual source estimation and plotting neural time series, and extracting neural activity in a given time window for a linear mixed model comparison.

The decoding folder includes examples of a decoding analysis that makes use of linear regression classification of MEG data.

All scripts have multiple contributing authors as they are templates drawn from the Neuroscience of Language Lab, NYU / NYU Abu Dhabi. These particular scripts were adapted to a specific project called Biphon.
